# crop-msp-prediction-app
An AI-powered Crop Minimum Support Price (MSP) Prediction Web App using XGBoost and Streamlit, with SMS alert and OTP verification via Twilio.

ðŸŒ¾ Crop MSP Prediction Web App
This project predicts the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of agricultural crops based on historical data using machine learning (XGBoost). It includes a user-friendly Streamlit interface and SMS notifications (with OTP verification) for farmers using Twilio.

Features:-
1.Crop MSP prediction using XGBoost Regressor
2.Intuitive UI built with Streamlit
3.OTP-based phone verification using Twilio Verify API
4.SMS alerts to farmers with predicted MSP

Technologies Used:-
1.Python
2.Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
3.XGBoost, scikit-learn
4.Streamlit
5.Twilio SMS & OTP verification API

Model Training:-
Model trained using:
    1.GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
    2.RÂ² Score for accuracy evaluation
    3.Actual vs Predicted MSP visualization
